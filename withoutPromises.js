// This is something what we call a callback hell!
// Async codes usually work with callbacks to maintain their behaviour (our behavious)
// Sometimes this code gets difficult to read and manage, so we have to find a solution for it
// To explain everything in brief
// --> Every async function gets executed after a time period
// --> To have our own desired output, or sequence we need to write functions such that they take callback functions
// --> Callback functions get executed by the function for us
// --> To maintain the sequence, we must do this heavy nesting which is usually not readable
